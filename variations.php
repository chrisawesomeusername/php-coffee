      <h5 class="card-title">Doppio</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Doppio espresso is a double shot, extracted using a double coffee filter in the portafilter. This results in 60 ml of drink, double the amount of a single shot espresso. More commonly called a standard double, it is a standard in judging the espresso quality in barista competitions. Doppio is Italian multiplier, meaning "double" but a doppio espresso doesn't exist in Italy.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Ritretto</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Ristretto is a "short shot" (60 ml) of a more highly concentrated espresso coffee. It is made with the same amount of ground coffee, but extracted with a finer grind (also in from 20 to 30 seconds) using half as much water. A normal short shot might look like a Ristretto, but in reality, would only be a weaker, more diluted, shot.The opposite of a Ristretto (which means in Italian, "shortened, narrow") is a lungo ("long"), which is a double shot. The French call a ristretto a café serré.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Americano</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Caffè Americano (also known as Americano or American is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added. The name is also spelled with varying capitalization and use of diacritics: e.g., café americano.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Flat White</h5>
      <p class="card-text">A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam (steamed milk with small, fine bubbles and a glossy or velvety consistency). It is comparable to a latte, but smaller in volume and with less microfoam, therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk, and milk that is more velvety in consistency – allowing the espresso to dominate the flavour, while being supported by the milk.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Caffè macchiato, sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted" so the literal translation of caffè macchiato is "stained” or “marked coffee.”</p>

      <p class="card-text">Lungo (Italian for "long") is a coffee beverage made by using an espresso machine to make an Italian-style coffee – short black (a single espresso shot) with much more water (generally twice as much), resulting in a larger coffee, a lungo.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Breve</h5>
      <p class="card-text">This drink is an Americanized version of the Italian cappuccino. It is just as simple as a latte, because it too only has two ingredients. It is an espresso-based drink that is made with half-and-half instead of milk. The half-and-half is frothed and added to the espresso to make a caffè breve. Caffè breves are fluffier, creamier, and richer than lattes. They’re more like cappuccinos, topped with quite a bit of rich foam.</p>
